The <b>Blade Models</b> have been specifically engineered for <i>hybrid particle-field Molecular Dynamics</i> (<b>hPF</b>), catering to both biological and polymer composite systems. These models encompass both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic resolutions.

The Biosystems Blade Models operate at a CG resolution, wherein a single bead approximates the representation of four heavy atoms (utilizing a four-to-one mapping). Presently, topologies are accessible for numerous surfactant structures, encompassing the most prevalent phospholipids (both zwitterionic and non-zwitterionic), as well as non-charged and charged surfactants such as Triton TX-100 and block-copolymers utilized in biological contexts, such as Pluronics, are available. The ongoing development of new topologies aims to augment the existing library.
